\details{
This function allows for batch processing of different species and different environmental RasterStacks. The function makes internal calls to \code{\link{ensemble.test.splits}}, \code{\link{ensemble.test}} and \code{\link{ensemble.raster}}. 

\code{\link{ensemble.test.splits}} results in a cross-validation procedure whereby the data set is split in calibration and testing subsets and the best weights for the ensemble model are determined (including the possibility for weights = 0).

\code{\link{ensemble.test}} is the step whereby models are calibrated using all the available presence data.

\code{\link{ensemble.raster}} is the final step whereby raster layers are produced for the ensemble model.

Function \code{ensemble.mean} results in raster layers that are based on the summary of several ensemble layers: the new ensemble has probability values that are the mean of the probabilities of the different raster layers, the presence-absence threshold is derived for this new ensemble layer, whereas the count reflects the number of ensemble layers where presence was predicted.

}

\value{
The function finally results in ensemble raster layers for each species, including the fitted values for the ensemble model, the estimated presence-absence and the count of the number of submodels prediction presence and absence.
